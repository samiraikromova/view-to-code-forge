# ========================================
# IMPORTANT NOTES FOR DEPLOYMENT
# ========================================
# 
# 1. NEVER include private keys in the frontend:
#    - SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY (server-side only)
#    - N8N API secrets (handled by n8n itself)
#    - Any private credentials
#
# 2. All Supabase operations use the anon key with RLS policies
#    Make sure your tables have proper RLS policies:
#    - users: Users can read/update their own row
#    - chat_threads: Users can CRUD their own threads
#    - messages: Users can CRUD messages in their threads
#    - usage_logs: Users can insert their own logs
#
# 3. n8n webhooks should be configured to:
#    - Accept CORS from your domain
#    - Validate requests as needed
#
# 4. For deployment (DigitalOcean, Vercel, Netlify, etc.):
#    - Set these environment variables in your hosting provider
#    - Build command: npm run build
#    - Output directory: dist/
